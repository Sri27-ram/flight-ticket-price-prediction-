# Flight-Fare-Prediction
---
> *Made for the coders elite event/hackathon*

> **Theme**: `Travel and Tourism`

The Datasets are extracted from `Kaggle`

**Problem**:
```
Travelling is something we all been wanting for,
especially with flights It can be a bit expensive.
If there was a way to find/predict the price of the flight with fewer information given
```

**Solution**:
```
We have come up with an idea where a 
Machine learning model could predict 
the prices of a flight using only the
*source*,*destination* and *date* of
journey
```

> The technique chosen to solve this is : **Regression**
---

**Algorithms Used:**

```
Have used Machine learning API called 
scikit-learn 
and for feature engineering and 
visualization we have used Numpy,Pandas and Matplotlib
```
1. *GridSearchCV*(For finding the best parameters for the algorithms)
2. *Ridge Regression*
3. *Lasso Regression*
4. *Logistic Regression*
5. *RandomForest Regressor*
6. *DecisionTree Regressor*

*Metrics Used:*
> Mean squared error(to determine the score of the model)
